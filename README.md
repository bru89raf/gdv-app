# gdv-app


## Project Description
```
First project using VUE ( with bootstrap) and Firebase.

The ideia was to create an CRUD application.

What you can find on the application:
    * Read Data
    * Authentication ( Login to specific emails) 
    * Insert 
    * Update
    * Delete

*Note*: This is the first project, so, if you find some issues / probems or things to improve, please let me know.

Demo [Page](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
    User / Pwd : test@noemail.com / testnoemail
